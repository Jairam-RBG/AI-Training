    "Python is a widely used general-purpose, interpreted programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and further developed by the Python Software Foundation. It was designed with an emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express their concepts in fewer lines of code.\n",

    "Since windows don’t come with Python preinstalled, it needs to be installed explicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First and foremost step is to open a browser and open https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/\n",
    "2. On this page move to Files and click on Windows x86-64 executable installer for 64-bit or Windows x86 executable installer for 32-bit.\n",
    "3. Run the Python Installer from downloads folder.\n",
    "4. Make sure to mark Add Python 3.7 to PATH otherwise you will have to do it explicitly.\n",
    "5. After installation is complete click on Close.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well done!! Now, Python is installed. Now go to windows and type IDLE.\n",

    "Like Linux, macOS also comes with Python pre-installed on the system. It might be Python version 2 or some similar outdated version. To update to the latest version, we will use the Homebrew Package manager. It is one of the best and convenient methods to install Python on macOS.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If you don’t have homebrew installed on your system, follow the steps below\n",
    "2. Open the Terminal Application of macOS from Application -> Utilities. Bash terminal will open where you can enter commands.\n",
    "3. Enter following command in macOS terminal.\n",
    "4. \"(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\".  Enter the system password if prompted. This will install the Homebrew package Manager on your OS.\n",
